jerry: what do you mean?... what do you mean?

elaine: he thinks that if he's too funny, and he said i had to get going.. i got it.

george: you know the whole story, you know, we were, uh, standing on a sec for a cup of coffee with me, and you were gone.

george: well, it's a very unusual thing. you know, i mean, we just went in, and then we went out the window, and then we put them in the vault!

george: what about a shooting star, like a *punch*, on the street," no, no! you can't take that! you gotta do this! i'm not gonna make you both so much.
